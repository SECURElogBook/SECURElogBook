			<i>
			One of the many things you can do with SECURElogBook is to create periodic reminders. Thanks to its built-in time calculation features, setting up these reminders is a breeze. You do not need to worry, as you can be sure that the time calculations will be done without any issues. <br>
			</i>
			</section>
			<br>
			Let's say we need to take a total of 6 pills and we need to take the medicine every 8 hours. <br>
			<br>
			We can create reminders one by one and waste time doing mental calculations or we can use the SECURElogBook functions that will make things easier for us. We can also check if what we have done is correct. <br>
			<br>
			For this example, we are going to use a case where we already have some records created (A, B, C, D, E, F). Those records will simulate records that you may already have: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-01.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>1.</b> The first thing we need to do is to open the creator window (green) by pressing <img src="pics/Open-creator-button.png" width="40" height="70"/> button: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-02_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Add ‚ÄúMedicine START‚Äù as text for this record. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>2.</b> TTo indicate we took the first pill, so we press <img src="pics/status_past_on.png" width="40" height="40"/> to indicate that we did it: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-03_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			The controls changed from yellow to black (background) to indicate that we took the first pill. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>3.</b> TTo create the first reminder, we will press <img src="pics/Copy-button.png" width="40" height="55"/> (copy button): <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-04_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Notice that we created a black record (past and completed), first record on the list. <br>
			<br>
			Because we cannot have two records with the same time, the record buttons are now red. To be able to copy or save a record we must change the time. <br>
			<br>
			Now we are going to create the next reminder. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>4.</b> TFirst change the reminder text from ‚ÄúMedicine START‚Äù to ‚ÄúMedicine‚Äù. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>5.</b> TNow we need to indicate that the record we are going to create is not completed. To do it press <img src="pics/status_past_off.png" width="40" height="40"/> button. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>6.</b> THold on <img src="pics/Add-time-button-creator.png" width="40" height="40"/> button to open the window to add not fixed values of time, use this window to add 8h: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-05_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			After we changed the time, adding 8h, the record buttons will be no longer red (blocked): <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-06_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Record buttons are now blue, to indicate that we can create a reminder in the future (blue). <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>7.</b> TCreate the new reminder by pressing <img src="pics/Copy-button.png" width="40" height="55"/> (copy button): <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-07_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>8.</b> TRepeat steps 6 and 7 three more times until we have 6 reminders for each pill of medicine. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>9.</b> TTo create last reminder, change the reminder text from ‚ÄúMedicine‚Äù to ‚ÄúMedicine END‚Äù. <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>10.</b> THold on <img src="pics/Add-time-button-creator.png" width="40" height="40"/> button to open the window to add not fixed values of time, use this window to add 8h: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-05_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>11.</b> TCreate the last reminder by pressing <img src="pics/Copy-button.png" width="40" height="55"/> (copy button): <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-08_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>12.</b> Press the back button on your device to go back to the main window (blue). <br>
			<br>
			Now that you have created all the reminders, how can you check that you have done it correctly? So far you will see something like this: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-09_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Think about if you have a lot of records‚Ä¶ How can I check that everything is correct? The answer to that question is the search. <br>
			<br>
			To open the search press <img src="pics/Search_button_main.jpg" width="40" height="40"/> button and search for ‚ÄúMedicine‚Äù: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-10_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Notice how the message at the bottom of the screen indicates that 6 records were found. The time between records is highlighted in yellow. <br>
			<br>
			You can also open again the search window to see that number at the of the title: <br>
			<img src="pics/Repetitive-tasks-11_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			As we can see, SECURElogBook search, allows us to see the number of records containing ‚ÄúMedicine‚Äù. But also, on the right side of each record, it indicates the time between the record and the next one. In this case is always 8 hours. <br>
			<br>
			Now we can confirm that we have 6 records, for 6 medicine pills, and the time between them is 8h. <br>
