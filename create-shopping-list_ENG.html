			<i>SECURElogBook also allows to create lists. Once a list is created you will be able to move and copy it.</i> <br>
			<br>
			<b>1.</b> Open SECURElogBook and go to the main window, with blue background: <br>
			<img src="pics/WindowMain.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>2.</b> Press the button (I), to add a new record/task. <br>
			<br>
			<b>3.</b> Once the creator window (green background) is opened we were able to create our record/task:<br>
			<img src="pics/WindowCreator.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			The small list with all the records (K) will show only records that match or follow the moment selected by time and date (D and F). <br>
			<br>
			<b>4.</b> By default, the record time is set to the present and the task is set as not completed. That is the reason why the record buttons (H, I, J) are yellow. <br>
			<br>
			When creating a record it is useful to have the current time set as the time of our record by default. Note that the phone time is the same as our record, 21:19 (image above). Thanks to that we can easily add or subtract time when we use the button to open the windows to help us manage time: <br>

			<section class="times-section">
				<i>These windows help you to add or subtract time without the possibility of making mistakes.</i>
			</section>
			<br>
			<b>5.</b> You can add any text but let’s call this list “Shopping list”: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>6.</b> Now that we have a yellow record we can save it, by pressing the button (H). <br>
			<br>
			<b>7.</b> Tap on the “Shopping list” record to edit it: <br>
			<img src="pics/WindowEditor.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>8.</b> The editor window (teal background) will display the “Shopping list” record. <br>
			<br>
			By default, when we edit a record, the record will be the first one on the editor window list of records. <br>
			<br>
			The small list with all the records (M) will show only records that match or follow the moment selected by time and date (D and F). <br>
			<br>
			<b>9.</b> Now we need to add the item name that we want to add to the list. You can type or you can use the favourite menu. <br>
			<br>
			<b>10.</b> Press the button (K) to add the item to the list. <br>
			<br>
			The items we add will be sorted in alphabetical order. <br>
			<br>
			Every time you add an item, by pressing K button, you will see how the item is added to the list in the small list with all the records. <br>
			<br>
			Button (K) will change from “L” (list) to “C” (copy) if we change the original time set for the record. You can reset the record data if you hold button (C). <br>
			<br>
			<b>11.</b>	Repeat steps 9 and 10 until you add all the items to the list. <br>
			<br>
			<b>12.</b>	Press the back button on your phone to complete the list and go to the main window. <br>
			<br>
			Once the list is created you can use the main record “Shopping list” to copy or move the entire list. <br>
			<br>
			You can set items inside the list as completed/not completed independently. <br>
