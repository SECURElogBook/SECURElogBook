			<i>SECURElogBook also allows to create lists. Once a list is created you will be able to move and copy it.</i> <br>
			<br>
			<b>1.</b> Open SECURElogBook and go to the main window, with blue background: <br>
			<img src="pics/WindowMain.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>2.</b> Press the button (I), to add a new record/task. <br>
			<br>
			<b>3.</b> Once the creator window (green background) is opened we were able to create our record/task:<br>
			<img src="pics/WindowCreator.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			The small list with all the records (K) will show only records that match or follow the moment selected by time and date (D and F). <br>
			<br>
			<b>4.</b> By default, the record time is set to the present and the task is set as not completed. That is the reason why the record buttons (H, I, J) are yellow. <br>
			<br>
			When creating a record it is useful to have the current time set as the time of our record by default. Note that the phone time is the same as our record, 21:19 (image above). Thanks to that we can easily add or subtract time when we use the button to open the windows to help us manage time: <br>

			<section class="times-section">
				<i>These windows help you to add or subtract time without the possibility of making mistakes.</i>
			</section>
			<br>
			<b>5.</b> You can add any text but let’s call this list “Shopping list”: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>6.</b> Now that we have a yellow record we can save it, by pressing the button indicated with the yellow arrow. <br>
			<br>
			<b>7.</b> Tap on the “Shopping list” record to edit it: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_2_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>8.</b> The editor window (teal background) will display the “Shopping list” record. <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_3_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			By default, when we edit a record, the record will be the first one on the editor window list of records. <br>
			<br>
			<b>9.</b> Type or select from favourites the item you want to add. In this case we are going to add “Bread”: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_4_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>10.</b> Press the button with the "L" (list) to add the item to the list: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_5_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Once the item is added the text box will be cleared. <br>
			<br>
			<b>11.</b> Now select from the menu or type "Eggs", then press the button with the "L" (list) to add the item to the list: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_6_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>12.</b> Now select from the menu or type "Milk", then press the button with the "L" (list) to add the item to the list: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_7_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Note that the items in the list will be sorted alphabetically. <br>
			<br>
			<b>13.</b> Press the back button on your phone to go back to the main window: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_8_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>14.</b> Tap on the "Shopping list" record to edit it: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_9_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Once we have a list, items are attached to the first record, "Shopping list". If we can use that record to move in time or create a copy of the entire list. <br>
			<br>
			<b>15.</b> To complete an item from the list we can HOLD on it. HOLD  your finger on "Eggs": <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_10_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>


			We can also complete or not complete every record in the list. For example we can indicate that "Eggs" are already in the trolley.

			<br>
			<b>12.</b>	Press the back button on your phone to complete the list and go to the main window. <br>
			<br>
			Once the list is created you can use the main record “Shopping list” to copy or move the entire list. <br>
			<br>
			You can set items inside the list as completed/not completed independently. <br>
