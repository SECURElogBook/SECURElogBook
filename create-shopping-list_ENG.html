			<i>SECURElogBook also allows to create lists. Once a list is created you will be able to move and copy it. <br>
			<br>
			The more you customize the menu to your needs, the easier and faster it will be to add items. <br>
			<br>
			Once you complete the list, you don't need to delete it. On the contrary, the more data the application has, the more it will help you. If you use the application to make your shopping lists, the search system will allow you to know things like: <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;. How often do you shopping? <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;. How often do you buy vegetables? <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;. If you add the name of the store, you can even find out where you bought that cake you liked so much! <br>
			<br>
			When you finish shopping, you can add the total price to the header of the list. Then if you do the same shopping in different shops, you will be able to see the difference in price. <br>

			<br>
			<b>1.</b> Open SECURElogBook and go to the main window, with blue background: <br>
			<img src="pics/WindowMain.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>2.</b> Press the button (I), to add a new record/task. <br>
			<br>
			<b>3.</b> Once the creator window (green background) is opened we were able to create our record/task:<br>
			<img src="pics/WindowCreator.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b><u>The small list with all the records (K) will show only records that match or follow the moment selected by time and date (D and F).</u></b> <br>
			<br>
			<b>4.</b> By default, the record time is set to the present and the task is set as not completed. That is the reason why the record buttons (H, I, J) are yellow. <br>
			<br>
			When creating a record it is useful to have the current time set as the time of our record by default. Note that the phone time is the same as our record, 21:19 (image above). Thanks to that we can easily add or subtract time when we use the button <img src="pics/help_time_adder.png" width="40" height="40"/> to open the windows to help us manage time: <br>

			<section class="times-section">
				<i>These windows help you to add or subtract time without the possibility of making mistakes.</i>
			</section>
			<br>
			<b>5.</b> You can name like you want your list, but let’s call this list “Shopping list”: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>6.</b> After adding the text “Shopping list” we can save it, by pressing the button indicated with the yellow arrow (image above). <br>
			<br>
			<b>7.</b> Tap on the “Shopping list” record to edit it: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_2_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>8.</b> The editor window (teal background) will display the “Shopping list” record. <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_3_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			By default, when we edit a record, the record will be the first one on the editor window list of records. <br>
			<br>
			<b>9.</b> Type or select from favourites the item you want to add. In this case we are going to add “Bread”: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_4_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>10.</b> After adding the text "Bread", press the button with the "L" (list), indicated with the yellow arrow (image above). This will add the item "Bread" to the list: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_5_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Once the item is added the text box will be cleared. <br>
			<br>
			<b>11.</b> Now select from the menu or type "Eggs". Then press the button with the "L" (list), indicated with the yellow arrow, to add the item to the list: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_6_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>12.</b> Now select from the menu or type "Milk". Then press the button with the "L" (list), indicated with the yellow arrow, to add the item to the list: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_7_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Note that the items in the list will be sorted alphabetically. <br>
			<br>
			<b>13.</b> Press the back button on your phone to go back to the main window: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_8_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>14.</b> Tap on the "Shopping list" record to edit it: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_9_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Once we have a list, items are attached to the first record, in this case "Shopping list". We can use that record to move in time or create a copy of the entire list. <br>
			<br>
			<b>15.</b> To complete an item from the list we can HOLD on it. HOLD  your finger on "Eggs". This will open the "Eggs" record: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_10_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			To complete "Eggs", to say that we already put them in the trolley, press the button indicated with the yellow arrow (image above). <br>
			<br>
			Now the record buttons are black, to indicate that the record "Eggs" is completed (in the trolley). <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_11_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			To save the record and go back, press the button indicated with the yellow arrow (image above). <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_12_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Now we can see that we "completed" the "Eggs" because now the record is black. <br>
			<br>
			<b>16.</b> Repeat step 15 until all items in the list are black. <br>
			<br>
			<b>17.</b> Now that everything is in the trolley, you can complete the "Shopping list" record: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_13_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>Well done! You manage to create your first shopping list!</b> <br>
			<br>
			Remember that with SECURElogBook you do not need to delete anything. The more information you add the more useful the app will be. You can add the name of the shop, the price, name of products, ... Like I said before, our grocery lists are not infinite. You can use one or more categories from Favourites menu to describe your own list of groceries. Then you will be able to see when you buy what, when it was last time you bought something, ... <br>
