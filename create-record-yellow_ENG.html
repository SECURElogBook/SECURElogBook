			<span style="font-size: 2.0em;"><u><b>Event registration</b> (yellow record)</u></span> <br>
			<br>
			<i>It is also possible to create a log to track something that is still running, like how long: <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;. Can you exercise? <br>
			&emsp;. You need to sleep to wake up without alarm. <br>
			&emsp;. Takes your cake to cool down. <br>
			&emsp;. How long it takes to cook the new recipe. <br>
			<br>
			When the task is completed, you can add the time to the record and that information will be yours for ever. Once you know that information, you can focus on the next thing that can to be improved. That is the idea behind SECURElogBook. <br>
			<br>
			This is also the type of record you can create if you have a great idea or just you realised you must do something today, but you do not have time to place it in the right time. You just want to remember it and be sure to check it today as it will be a yellow record. It is a good practice to review your yellow records one or two times a day. </i><br>
			<br>
			1. Open SECURElogBook and go to the main window, with blue background: <br>
			<img src="pics/WindowMain.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			2. Press the button (I), to add a new record/task. <br>
			<br>
			3. Once the creator window (green background) is opened we were able to create our record/task: <br>
			<img src="pics/WindowCreator.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			The small list with all the records (K) will show only records that match or follow the moment selected by time and date (D and F). <br>
			<br>
			4. By default, the record time is set to the present and the task is set as not completed. That is the reason why the record buttons (H, I, J) are yellow. <br>
			<br>
			5. Add the text inside the text box. If you save a record/task with no text, the program will add “NO TEXT” by default. <br>
			<br>
			6. Because we are recording an event that is still running, we don't need to do anything. A new record, by default, is set to the current time and not completed. Therefore, the recording buttons (H, I, J) will be yellow. <br>
			<br>
			The colour of the record buttons (H, I, J) is like a preview of how the record we are creating will look like. <br>
			<br>
			7. Now that we have a yellow record we can save it, by pressing the button (H). <br>
			<br>
			8. If the records buttons turn red, is because there is already a record set with that date and time. That means you cannot save your record there. This record with the same time, will be the first one in the list or records. <br>
			<br>
			9. Save the record by pressing the button H. You will see a <u>confirmation message with a <b>black background:</b></u> <br>
			<br>
			&emsp;<b>. Black =</b> past. <br>
			&emsp;<b>. Red =</b> today. <br>
			&emsp;<b>. Blue =</b> tomorrow. <br>
			&emsp;<b>. Green =</b> beyond the day after tomorrow. <br>
			<br>
			<i>EXAMPLE OF POSSIBLE ERROR: if you created a record to register an event in the past but the confirmation message was not black you have a problem. Because you created a record in the future, and it will have an alarm. You can always press the button (G) on the main window to open the last saved record to fix the problem. </i><br>
			<br>
			Congratulations you just saved your first event. <br>
