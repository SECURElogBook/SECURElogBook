			<br>
			<i>
			Suppose we have to go to the hospital for a test in 4 days at 9:10am. <br>
			<br>
			Since it is a very important appointment, it is a good idea to have a reminder the day before. <br>
			<br>
			Then, you can create a second reminder on the same day to let you know when you have to leave the house. To avoid being late, you have decided that you need to leave the house 1 hour and 45 minutes early. <br>
			<br>
			Finally, we will create a third reminder for the actual hospital appointment. This will allow us to see how long time we have for the appointment at any time. <br>

			<br>
			You can grab a pen and paper and do some calculations, or you can use the SECURElogBook and create everything with a few taps on the screen. <br>
			<br>
			SECURElogBook has windows to add or subtract time with no errors, so scheduling tasks is very easy. Also, it has a button to create copies of records.<br>
			</i>
			<br>
			<b>1.</b> Open SECURElogBook and go to the main window, with blue background: <br>
			<img src="pics/Main-to-creator.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>2.</b> Create a new record by pressing the button indicated with the yellow arrow (image above). <br>
			<br>
			<b>3.</b> Once the creator window is open (green background) we can edit the record: <br>
			<img src="pics/ShoppingList_creator_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>4.</b> Call this record ‚ÄúHospital appointment‚Äù by adding the text inside the text box indicated with the yellow arrow (image above): <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<section class="times-section">
				<i>The current date is at the top of the screen (green background). The date of our record is above the list (blue background).</i><br>
			</section>
			<br>
			<b>5.</b> Now we need to set the date and time for 4 days from now. Add 4 days to the current date, since today is 01/07/2024, the date will be 05/07/2024 at 9:10am: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_2_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<section class="times-section">
				<i>The record buttons will turn blue to indicate we are working in the future.</i><br>

			<br>
			<b>6.</b> Press the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button to create a copy of this record: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_3_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<section class="times-section">
				<i>Notice that the record buttons now are red. This is to indicate that we cannot save or create a copy as we already have a record in that time (that record is the one we just created, in the list). You must change the time to be able to save or copy the record if the record buttons are red.</i><br>
			</section>
			<br>
			<b>7.</b> Change the text to create the next record. Replace the text for ‚ÄúHospital in 1h and 45min‚Äù. <br>
			<br>
			<b>8.</b> In order to create another copy, we need to change the time. Remember that we want to leave 1h and 45min before the hospital appointment. To change the time, you can do the math mentally or you can use the dedicated window to calculate the time by holding down this button <img src="pics/help_time_adder.png" width="40" height="40"/>. Input ‚Äú-1‚Äù hour and ‚Äú-45‚Äù minutes: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_4_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>9.</b> Press the ‚ÄúADD‚Äù button. <br>
			<br>
			<b>10.</b> Press the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button to create a copy of this record: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_5_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>11.</b> Change the text to create the next record. Replace the text for ‚ÄúHospital tomorrow‚Äù. <br>
			<br>
			<b>12.</b> Select the day before pressing the blue date button to open the calendar: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_6_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			<b>13.</b> Press ‚ÄúSELECT‚Äù button. <br>

			<b>Congratulations, SECURElogBook advanced user! You have just created several records quickly. You are now in full control of the situation!</b> <br>
			<br>
			Thanks to the copy button we can create multiple records in a few seconds: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_9_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			In a few seconds and without mental calculations that could be wrong, we created all we need to have total control. We have created a record a day before (A). A record to let us know when we need to leave the house (B). We decided that we need to leave the house 1h and 45min before to be safe, and you can see it that it is right. Finally, we have a record with the actual hospital appointment, our goal. The time indicated by (D) will change every minute, so at any time you will know how much time you have left for your appointment: <br>

			<section class="times-section">
				<i>That is how the screen will look like at 9:05am, 5min before your hospital appointment at 9:10am. </i><br>

			You are now an advanced SECURElogBook user! You can now create multiple records quickly to keep a complete control of the situation. <br>
