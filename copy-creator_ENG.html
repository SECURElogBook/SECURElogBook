			<br>
			<i>
			Suppose we have to go to the hospital for a test in 4 days at 9:10am. <br>
			<br>
			You do not want to be late so it is a good idea to have a reminder the day before, to make sure you will not add anything around that time. <br>
			<br>
			Then you can create a second reminder on the same day. In order not to be late, you have decided that you must leave home 1 hour and 45 minutes early. <br>
			<br>
			Finally, we will create a third reminder for the actual hospital appointment. This will allow us to see how long time we have for the appointment at any time. <br>
			</i>
			<br>
			Because SECURElogBook has been made to manage your time we will be able to do this in a few seconds! <br>
			<br>
			1.	Open SECURElogBook and go to the main window, with blue background: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			2.	Create a new record by pressing the button indicated with the yellow arrow (image above). <br>
			<br>
			3.	Once the creator window is open (green background) we can edit the record: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			4.	Call this list “Hospital appointment” by adding the text inside the text box indicated with the yellow arrow (image above): <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			5.	Now we need to set the date and time for 4 days from now. Add 4 days to the current date, since today is 01/07/2024, the date will be 05/07/2024 at 9:10am: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<section class="times-section">
				<i>The record buttons will turn blue to indicate we are working in the future.</i><br>
				<i>The current date is at the top of the screen (green background). The date of our record is above the list (blue background).</i><br>
			</section>
			<br>
			6.	Press the “C” button to create a copy of this record: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<section class="times-section">
				<i>Notice that the record buttons now are red. This is to indicate that we cannot save or create a copy as we already have a record in that time. You must change the time to be able to save or copy the record if the record buttons are red.</i><br>
			</section>
			<br>
			7.	Change the text to create the next record. Replace the text for “Hospital in 1h and 45min”. <br>
			<br>
			8.	In order to create another copy, we need to change the time. Remember that we want to leave 1h and 45min before the hospital appointment. To change the time, you can do the math mentally or you can use the dedicated window to calculate the time by holding down this button <img src="pics/help_time_adder.png" width="40" height="40"/>. Input “-1” hour and “-45” minutes: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			9.	Press the “ADD” button. <br>
			<br>
			10.	Press the “C” button to create a copy of this record: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br><br>
			<br>
			11.	Change the text to create the next record. Replace the text for “Hospital tomorrow” <br>
			12.	Select the day before pressing the blue date button to open the calendar: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			13.	Press “SELECT” button. <br>
			14.	Press the “C” button to create a copy of this record: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			15.	Press the back button on your device to go back to the main window (blue): <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			Thanks to the copy button we can create multiple records in a few seconds: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			<br>
			In a few seconds and without mental calculations that could be wrong, we created all we need to have total control. We have created a record a day before (A). A record to let us know when we need to leave the house (B). We decided that we need to leave the house 1h and 45min before to be safe, and you can see it that it is right. Finally, we have a record with the actual hospital appointment, our goal. The time indicated by (D) will change every minute, so at any time you will know how much time you have left for your appointment: <br>
			<img src="pics/Creator-copy_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
			That is how the screen will look like at 9.05am, 5min before your hospital appointment. <br>
			<br>
			With SECURElogBook, information goes in and worries go out! So now you can carry on with your life! 😉<br>
