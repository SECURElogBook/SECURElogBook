            <i>SECURElogBook is an innovative concept designed as a versatile tool applicable to both your personal and professional life. <br>
            <br>
            This software, designed with flexibility in mind, empowers you to track your past activities and organize future plans. Rather than constantly worrying about staying on top of everything, you’ll have a reliable private assistant that not only reminds you of what’s important but also assists in scheduling your day. This frees your mind, allowing you to fully enjoy life. <br>
            <br>
            SECURElogBook prioritizes two key aspects: data management and security. It has been meticulously crafted for fast and straightforward data entry, all while ensuring it operates offline and doesn’t access your files. <br>
            <br>
            I have been working on this project for more than 4 years. I have dedicated my savings and 100% of my time on this project for the last 2 years. As a result, SECURElogBook has evolved into a high-quality, multifunctional tool. <br>
            <br>
            Despite its user-friendly design, some people that are currently testing SECURElogBook haven’t fully grasped the potential behind idea. That is normal, because I designed SECURElogBook as a powerful flexible tool. That means, that the more you know and the more information you add to the program the more it will give you back. <br>
            <br>
            Allow me to explain what SECURElogBook is.</i><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            SECURElogBook was designed as a powerful versatile data tool. <br>
            <br>
            To make this idea possible, I’ve invested a lot of time time.
            <br>
            Also, I needed to create the technology to make it possible: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. A timeline and records system that allows the program to work like we do. People and SECURElogBook store information in a timeline. That allows you to remember everything you add to the program. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Robust records handling system to make clear and easy to add, see, edit and search your information. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Time/complete colour code system to make possible to store important information in a visible language that everyone can understand. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Task counters system that allows to predict your workload. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Built to remember everything thanks to how SECURElogBook has been designed. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Quality of life and details to make everything logic, easy, fast while minimizing mistakes. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Relative times values to fully control time, no more wasted time trying to understand your information. Your information gives you dynamically all you need. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Dynamic lists for when you need something that cannot be described as a single record. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. SECURITY and PRIVACY to have the peace of mind that your data is yours. <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Search system that allows you to find everything and group information, allowing you to draw conclusions and improve every day! <br>
            <br>
            When you combine all those systems in one program, like SECURElogBook does, you can do: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;1. Alarms. <br>
            &emsp;2. Screen time tracker. <br>
            &emsp;3. Diet tracker. <br>
            &emsp;4. Reminders. <br>
            &emsp;5. Shopping list app. <br>
            &emsp;6. Money tracker. <br>
            &emsp;7. Medication intake log. <br>
            &emsp;8. Calendar. <br>
            &emsp;9. Personal motivator. <br>
            &emsp;10. Fitness tracker. <br>
            &emsp;11. Mental health diary. <br>
            &emsp;12. Personal organiser. <br>
            &emsp;13. Tool for remembering everything. <br>
            &emsp;14. Habit tracker. <br>
            &emsp;15. Schedule your work. <br>
            &emsp;16. Tool for improvement, as you can analyse your data with the search system and learn from it. <br>
            &emsp;17. Personal diary. <br>
            &emsp;And much more! <br>
            <br>
            Thanks to SECURElogBook design everything is secure, easy, straightforward, and fast. Thanks to the smart design you won’t hesitate to add what’s important to you. <br>
            <br>
            Once it’s inside SECURElogBook, you won’t forget it. <br>
            <br>
            The app for everything, right at your fingertips! <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2><u>Timeline and records</u></h2>
            We are constantly doing something. We can either plan for future actions or act immediately. However, as time passes, everything transitions into the past. Thus, everything we do is encapsulated within our timeline. <br>
            <br>
            SECURElogBook is a program that is able to record information in the same timeline: <br>
            <img src="pics/Timeline_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            Everything we do or plan happens always on a specific day and time: <br>
            <img src="pics/RecordExample_ENG.jpg" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            These tasks, ideas, alarms, reminders, and more can be seen as records contained into our life’s timeline. <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2><u>Robust records handling system</u></h2>
            Now we know that SECURElogBook is able to store information like us, inside of a timeline. <br>
            <br>
            How we can handle the information so it is fast and easy to introduce. <br>
            <br>
            I have created a solid simple system to manage information using dedicated windows: <br>
            <img src="pics/RecordManagamentSystem_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            Basically, I created a structure with 3 windows: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Creator (green) to introduce new information into the system. <br>
            &emsp;. Main window (blue) to allow see and search your information. <br>
            &emsp;. Editor (green) to be able to change information of a record once you tap on it in the main window (blue) <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Main window (blue)</u><br>
            <br>
            The main window with the blue background allows you to see and search information: <br>
            <img src="pics/WindowMain.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            A = Task counters. Allow to see the missing alarms/tasks and workload for today and tomorrow. <br>
            B = Date button. This will move the main list to the next yellow record or the present time. <br>
            C = Settings. Access to: security PIN, audio settings, date format, delete system, import/export system and about window. <br>
            D = Help. Documentation for this window. <br>
            E = App lock button. <br>
            F = List of records. Here you can find all your data. Tap on a record to edit it. <br>
            G = Last record. This button opens last record that you saved or copied. <br>
            H = Search. It will allow to find what you are looking for and group information to draw conclusions from your data. <br>
            I = Add record. It opens the green record creator window. <br>
            J = Stop alarm button. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Creator window (green)</u><br>
            <br>
            Once the creator window is open the record is set to not completed by default and the time is always set to the current time, past. That is why we see a yellow text box and buttons. <br>
            <br>
            It’s crucial to understand that the list will display records that match or follow the moment of the record we are creating (D and F). Additionally, altering the time (D) or date (F) values will dynamically update the list to show future records (K). <br>
            <img src="pics/WindowCreator.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            A = Time seeker buttons. Up, to select previous record time. Down, to select next record time. These buttons even the time of the current record with an existing one. Once both records are at the same time you can add or remove time to perfectly control when the new record will be triggered. <br>
            B = Record text. <br>
            C = Update time button. It will set our record with the current time. <br>
            D = Time values. To set the hours and minutes of your record. <br>
            E = Add time windows: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;TAP = Window with preset values that you can customise. <br>
            &emsp;<img src="pics/Dialog_Time_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            &emsp;HOLD = Window that allows to add or remove time and date values. <br>
            &emsp;<img src="pics/Dialog_Time_2_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            F = Calendar. It will open the calendar to allow to select a date. <br>
            G = Favourites. This will open a menu that you can customise with the things you do regularly so instead of writing you will be able to select your things from a list. <br>
            H = Save button. <br>
            I = Complete button. Use it to indicate if the record is completed (dark background) or not completed (yellow background on past or blue on the future). <br>
            J = Copy button. This will create a copy of the record. Remember that copy and save buttons will become red when there is already a record using that exact time. <br>
            K = List of records. Here you can find all your data. Hold on a record to edit it. <br>
            L = Help. Documentation for this window. <br>
            M = Stop alarm button. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Editor window (teal)</u><br>
            <br>
            Like with the creator window (green background), it’s crucial to understand that the list will display records that match or follow the moment of the record we selected (D and F). Additionally, altering the time (D) or date (F) values will dynamically update the list to show future records (K). <br>
            <img src="pics/WindowEditor.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            A = Time seeker buttons. Up, to select previous record time. Down, to select next record time. These buttons even the time of the current record with an existing one. Once both records are at the same time you can add or remove time to perfectly control when the new record will be triggered. <br>
            B = Record text. <br>
            C = Update/Restore time button. TAP = It will set our record with the current time. HOLD = It will restore the record’s values (text, time and date). <br>
            D = Time values. To set the hours and minutes of your record. <br>
            E = Add time windows: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;TAP = Window with preset values that you can customise. <br>
            &emsp;<img src="pics/Dialog_Time_1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            &emsp;HOLD = Window that allows to add or remove time and date values. <br>
            &emsp;<img src="pics/Dialog_Time_2_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            F = Calendar. It will open the calendar to allow to select a date. <br>
            G = Favourites. This will open a menu that you can customise with the things you do regularly so instead of writing you will be able to select your things from a list. <br>
            H = Clear record text button. <br>
            I = Save button. <br>
            J = Complete button. Use it to indicate if the record is completed (dark background) or not completed (yellow background on past or blue on the future). <br>
            K = List(L)/Copy(C) button. This button will change its behaviour depending on the record time: <br>
            <br>
            LIST: If we do not change the record time, we can press the list button “L” to add an item and create a list. <br>
            <br>
            COPY: If we change the record time, the button will change to “C” to allow to create a copy the record. This feature is particularly handy for setting up advance alerts for important reminders. <br>
            <br>
            L = Delete record button. Use it to delete the current record. Be aware there is a powerful delete system inside the settings button on the main window (blue). <br>
            M = List of records. Here you can find all your data. Hold on a record to edit it. <br>
            N = Help. Documentation for this window. <br>
            O = Stop alarm button. <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2><u>Time/complete colour code system</u></h2>
            OK, SECURElogBook allows you to record information like we do. We store things in the past or in the future inside our timeline. But we also remember if we completed something or not. <br>
            <br>
            SECURElogBook, like you, can also record if we did or not something. To indicate whether you’ve completed something or not, there is a button to toggle between ‘not completed’ and ‘completed’: <br> 
            <img src="pics/CompleteButtonExplanation_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            Imagine having a list of everything you’ve done and everything you plan to do right in front of you. <br>
            <br>
            Having all that information in a small screen will mean small text, a lot of written information, … that will create a very bad user experience. <br>
            <br>
            Colours can serve as a layer of information to simplify understanding. By condensing completion status and whether a record belongs to the past or future into a single colour, it’s like when we interpret green or red lights in a traffic signal. <br>
            <br>
            SECURElogBook system transforms the past/future and no completed/completed information into colours, making things faster and easier: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Past: <br>
            &emsp; &emsp;Completed <img src="pics/status_past_off.png" width="40" height="40"/> / Not completed <img src="pics/status_past_on.png" width="40" height="40"/><br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Future: <br>
            &emsp; &emsp;Completed <img src="pics/status_future_off.png" width="40" height="40"/> / Not completed (alarm activated) <img src="pics/status_future_on.png" width="40" height="40"/><br>
            <br>
            The colour code system automatically makes less important records less visible while highlighting important ones: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Dark: Completed records. <br>
            &emsp;. Yellow: Missing records, that you must review as soon as possible. <br>
            &emsp;. Blue: Future records. <br>
            <br>
            Thanks to the colour code system, instead of checking the current time and comparing it with the record time, you can simply glance at the colour to determine if a record is completed or not, and whether it’s in the future or the past. <br>
            <br>
            The colour code system ensures that even with thousands of records in your SECURElogBook, you can quickly identify what requires your attention. Bright colours naturally draw our focus, which is why missing tasks or alarms are highlighted in yellow, while future tasks are represented in bright blue. <br>
            <br>
            This picture represents the same data at different times. The colour code system highlights automatically the important information: <br>
            <img src="pics/VisualInformationList_ENG.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            These two phones, in the image above, show the same information at different times. <br>
            <br>
            The colours change to help you to see where the important records (yellows and blues) are. The present is always where records change from black or yellow to blue. <br>
            <br>
            No matter how many records you have, understanding the information is very easy once you understand the colour code system: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Dark = Not important. <br>
            &emsp;. Blue = Future records. <br>
            &emsp;. Yellow = Very important records that you must review. <br>
            The colour code system also prevents mistakes. For instance, if you want to set an alarm to wake up tomorrow, your record must be blue, since yellow and black records pertain to the past. Also notice that <img src="pics/status_future_on.png" width="40" height="40"/> future not completed status icon is the only one featuring an image of an enabled alarm. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h2><u>Task counters system</u></h2>
            The tasks counters are like a radar that allow to figure out your workload at different times. These are a set of values displayed on the top left corner of the SECURElogBook window. <br>
            <br>
            SECURElogBook store all the tasks, alarms, records, reminders, lists, ideas, … everything in an infinite list of records. <br>
            <br>
            Having an infinite list with your data looks cool, but it is a nightmare if there are no system that gives meaning to what you are looking at. <br>
            <br>
            While having an infinite list with your data may appear cool, it becomes a nightmare if there isn’t a system that provides context and meaning to what you’re viewing. <br>
            <br>
            Essentially, the task counters in SECURElogBook provide crucial information through a simple, visually intuitive representation that combines colours, numbers, time, and sizes: <br> 
            <img src="pics/TaskCounterExplanation.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            Past missed records (A), today (B) and tomorrow (C). <br>
            <br>
            Basically, these values on the top left corner of SECURElogBook, display the number of: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Yellow: Missing records. <br>
            &emsp;. Red (first): Records in less than 1h (records with short red bar). <br>
            &emsp;. Red (second): Records after 1h and 8h. (records with half red bar). <br>
            &emsp;. Red (third): Total active records for today. <br>
            &emsp;. Blue: Records for tomorrow. <br>
            <br>
            Now you know how the task counters system works, scheduling your day becomes easier. In no time, you’ll be able to assess how many tasks you can handle. With SECURElogBook, you can strategically allocate tasks, especially on busy days. <br>
            <br>
            If our task counter shows these values [<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">1</span><span style="background-color: red; color: white;"> 1</span><span style="background-color: red; color: white;">1</span><span style="background-color: red; color: white;">3 </span><span style="background-color: blue; color: white;">1</span>]
             that means: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Yellow = 1 missing thing I must review as soon as possible. <br>
            &emsp;. Red (first) = I have 1 thing to do in less than 1h (record with short red bar). <br>
            &emsp;. Red (second) = There is 1 something I need to do after 1h and in less than 8h. (record with half red bar). <br>
            &emsp;. Red (third) = There are 3 tasks left for today. <br>
            &emsp;. Blue = Tomorrow I will have 1 task to do. <br>
            <br>
            Now, you can use that information to find what you want inside the list: <br>
            <img src="pics/TaskCounterList.png" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            &emsp;. Yellow counter => Yellow records. <br>
            &emsp;. Red (first) => Records with short red bar. <br>
            &emsp;. Red (second) => Records with half red bar. <br>
            &emsp;. Blue => Records with blue bar. <br>

<h2><u>Built to remember everything</u></h2>
SECURElogBook ensures that you remember everything you add to it due to its carefully designed structure. <br>
<br>
If you use SECURElogBook to create a record to help you to remember something <img src="pics/status_future_on.png" width="40" height="40"/>, when the present reaches the time of that record it will turn yellow <img src="pics/status_past_on.png" width="40" height="40"/> and the alarm will go off. Now, that record will be added to the number of yellow records (missing tasks/records). <br>
<br>
Because yellow records (missing tasks/records) are very important. The yellow task counter, the notification and the app icon badge will show the number of yellow tasks (missing tasks/records). <br>
<br>
When you want to indicate that task/record is completed, you must press the complete button. The record will change from not completed <img src="pics/status_past_on.png" width="40" height="40"/> to completed <img src="pics/status_past_off.png" width="40" height="40"/>. By obscuring the record, we make the record unimportant. <br>
<br>
SECURElogBook has been carefully designed to make hard to change not completed status for completed status accidentally. On one hand, you must open the editor window to edit the record. On the other hand, the colour will change indicating that the value has changed. <br>
<br>
Basically, once you add something to your SECURElogBook it is impossible to forget it! <br>
