            Welcome to the SECURElogBook website!<br>
            <br>
            Just like SECURElogBook itself, this website will continue to evolve with time. My primary goal is to publish it after more than 4 years of dedicated work.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, the website serves as a hub for SECURElogBook users during its closed beta stage (Early Access). To launch SECURElogBook on Google Play, I need to conduct a closed test with at least 20 users actively using the app for 14 consecutive days.<br>
            <br>
            Over the past 4 years, I’ve honed my skills and developed the technology that powers SECURElogBook. For the last 2 years, I’ve invested my savings and 100% of my time into creating this powerful, flexible tool that’s now in your hands—whether you use it at work or elsewhere.<br>
            <br>
            While I’ve priced the app at less than 2 Euros, this aligns with a new Google Play policy. By participating in the close test, you’re helping us move this project forward.<br>
            <br>
            Rest assured, SECURElogBook is meticulously crafted to be error-free. Extensive testing and feedback from early users confirm its reliability.<br>
            <br>
            When you pay for SECURElogBook, you’re investing in a high-quality program that could potentially transform your life. Your feedback matters, too! Feel free to suggest new features or report any issues you encounter.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you to those already using the app—the version you’ll receive is even better. As I continue to enhance SECURElogBook, I’ll prioritize flexibility and usability.<br>
            <br>
            Remember, SECURElogBook isn’t just another program—it’s a powerful, adaptable tool designed for various tasks, whether you’re at work or not. And yes, I’m actively exploring an automatic feature for creating repetitive tasks (weekly, monthly, yearly) without compromising the tool’s versatility.<br>
            <br>
            Join us in shaping the future of SECURElogBook!<br>
