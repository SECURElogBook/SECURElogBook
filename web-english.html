            <h2><u>1. Welcome to the SECURElogBook website!</u></h2>
            <i>I value honesty, and I want to share that SECURElogBook is a project I’ve created entirely on my own.<br>
            <br>
            SECURElogBook relies exclusively on code developed by either Android or myself. I made this decision for safety reasons and to ensure that the project remains independent. There’s a saying I particularly appreciate: ‘A camel is a horse designed by a committee.’<br>
            <br>
            I’m capable of handling everything—from coding to designing the user interface, creating the website, producing YouTube videos, and even learning new skills, just as I’ve done with Google Play. Admittedly, it’s challenging to publish an app when you’re flying solo. On one hand, doing everything independently takes time. On the other hand, it allows me to maintain control over the quality of my work.<br>
            <br>
            Like SECURElogBook itself, this website will continue to evolve over time. My primary goal is to publish it after more than four years of dedicated effort. I’ve invested not only my savings but also the last two years of hard work into this project.<br>
            <br>
            Just like SECURElogBook itself, this website will continue to evolve with time. My primary goal is to publish it after more than 4 years of dedicated work.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, the website serves as a community hub for SECURElogBook users during its closed beta stage (Early Access). To launch SECURElogBook on Google Play, I need to conduct a closed test with at least 20 users actively using the app for 14 consecutive days.</i><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Over the past 4 years, I’ve honed my skills and developed the technology that powers SECURElogBook. For the last 2 years, I’ve invested my savings and 100% of my time into creating this powerful, flexible tool that’s now in your hands—whether you use it at work or elsewhere.<br>
            <br>
            While I’ve priced the app at less than 2 Euros, this aligns with a new Google Play policy. By participating in the close test, you’re helping us move this project forward.<br>
            <br>
            Rest assured, SECURElogBook is meticulously crafted to be error-free. Extensive testing and feedback from early users confirm its reliability.<br>
            <br>
            When you pay for SECURElogBook, you’re investing in a high-quality program that could potentially transform your life. Your feedback matters, too! Feel free to suggest new features or report any issues you encounter (Link at the bottom of the page).<br>
            <br>
            Thank you to those already using the app—the version you’ll receive is even better. As I continue to enhance SECURElogBook, I’ll prioritize flexibility and usability.<br>
            <br>
            Remember, SECURElogBook isn’t just another program—it’s a powerful, adaptable tool designed for various tasks, whether you’re at work or not. And yes, I’m actively exploring an automatic feature for creating repetitive tasks (weekly, monthly, yearly) without compromising the tool’s versatility.<br>
            <br>

            <h1><u>5. Let’s help each other!</u></h1>
            Thanks in advance!<br>
            <br>
            I need 20 people that will use the app for 14 days continuously, this is the close test. Once we achieve this milestone, SECURElogBook will be publicly available for everyone to download.<br>
            <br>
            This video will give you an idea of the process that the app must follow to be able to be public on Google Play:<br>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pq3KoTsoCAk?autoplay=0&mute=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br>
            <br>
            1. To be able to participate in the close test you must be invited. Google Play will use your Gmail to allow you to download the app once you are invited.<br>
            <br>
            2. To be invited you need to send me your Gmail account.<br>
            <br>
            3. How to find your Gmail account?<br>
            &emsp;. Open Google Play.<br>
            &emsp;. Click on the icon on the top right corner (1).<br>
            &emsp;. That is the Gmail account that Google Play is using (2).<br>
            <img src="GmailLocation.jpg" class="responsive"/><br>
            <br>
            <u>Only the one above will work, the Gmail used to access Google Play.</u><br>
            <br>
            4. Send me that Gmail I will add you to the close test list. This is my Gmail: <a href="mailto:mgllgmsama5@gmail.com">mgllgmsama5@gmail.com</a> The easiest way is to send me an email using <b>your phone.</b> This normally will use the Gmail account linked to your Google Play. Add this: I want to participate in Google Play SECURElogBook close test. This will let me know that I need to send you an invitation.<br>
            <br>
            5. I will add your Gmail to the close test list.<br>
            <br>
            6. I will send you a Google Play link to be able to download the app from Google Play (Without being invited SECURElogBook will not be visible).<br>
            <br>
            7. You will receive an email from me (mgllgmsama5@gmail.com) with the invitation link inside. Once you open the link, you will see the invitation with a button to accept being a tester (bottom). This will enable you to download the app from the link on the top of the message.<br>
            <br>
            Now you can download SECURElogBook!<br>
            <br>
