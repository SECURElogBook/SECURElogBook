		<br>
		This manual will show you how to use the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> to export specific records to share them. <br>
		<br>
		This will allow to find specific records and copy them as text. Then you will be able to share the information with other SECURElogBook users. <br>
		<br>
		Let’s say you want to send your coffee with cinnamon recipe to your friend. <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-1_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		Notice that we labeled our record using the word “RECIPE”, in front. If we label all recipes with the same word, we can search for “RECIPE” to only show all recipes. Labeling records, will make easier to find things when we will have thousands of records. <br>
		<br>
		You can use the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> to select what you want to send to your friend. In this case we want to send to our friend our recipe for coffee with cinnamon. <br>
		<br>
		<b>1.</b> Open the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> by pressing <img src="pics/Search-button.png" width="40" height="40"/> in the main window (blue) and write something that is only present in the record/s that we are looking for, in this case “RECIPE: Coffee with cinnamon”: <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-2_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		Because we are using the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> to select what we want, you can use the flexibility of the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> to find exactly what you want. 
		<br>
		<b>2.</b> Press “SEARCH”. <br>
		<br>
		Now SECURElogBook will only show the search results: <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-3_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		<b>3.</b> Open the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> again by pressing <img src="pics/Search-button.png" width="40" height="40"/> <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-4_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		Now, because there are search results, the <a href="search-system_ENG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search system</a></span> will show two extra buttons on the bottom left corner. <br>
		<br>
		<b>4.</b> Press the bottom left button, indicated with a yellow arrow in the picture above, to open the “DATA EXPORT” window. <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-5_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		This window will generate blocks of data, text information, that you can copy and paste. The more information your search result will have the more blocks of data will be created. <br>
		<br>
		<b>5.</b> Hold on the data block to copy it. <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-6_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		<u>Remember that <b>if you close the “DATA EXPORT” window, the information will be removed from the clip board</b> to do not allow other apps to access to your information.</u> <br>
		<br>
		<b>6.</b> Paste the information in the instant messaging app or email app to share the information with your friend. <br>
		<img src="pics/Search-export-7_ENG.png" class="responsive"/> <br>
		<br>
		You can also share the information without internet, using USB drive, USB memory or SD card. <br>
		<br>
		Remember that you can protect your information. 7-Zip is a free and open-source file archiver for Windows. You can use it to password/encrypt protect your information. <br>
		<br>
		Now your friend will be able to import the information to the application to create a record with the cinnamon coffee recipe. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
